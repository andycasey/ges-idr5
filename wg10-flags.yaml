# These are all the unique flags used in WG10:

# > 10010-10-05-00-A # No results or inaccurate results: SNR < 10 for at least one setting
# > 10050-10-05-00-A # No results or inaccurate results: SNR < 50 for at least one setting
# > 10153-10-05-01-A # Discrepant radial velocities (use suffix to specify the threshold; e.g., |RV_max-RV_min| > 5*err_RV )
# > 10302-10-05-01-A # Code convergence issue: one of more convergence criteria (node-specific) could not be fulfilled. Criteria to be described using the suffix
# > 10302-10-15-01-A # Code convergence issue: one of more convergence criteria (node-specific) could not be fulfilled. Criteria to be described using the suffix
# > 10308-10-05-01-A # One or more parameter (which could not be identified) outside the node's grid; if possible rather use 10303-10307 flags
# > 10399-10-06-00-B # No parameters provided because of lack of time
# > 13020-10-05-01-A # Suspicious stellar parameters because temperature (Teff) is on the node's grid edge. Conditions to be described using the suffix
# > 13021-10-05-01-A # Suspicious stellar parameters because gravity (log g) is on the node's grid edge. Conditions to be described using the suffix
# > 13022-10-05-01-A # Suspicious stellar parameters because metallicity ([M/H] or [Fe/H]) is on the node's grid edge. Conditions to be described using the suffix

# Anything matching these flags will cause us to mark that particular node 
# result as being suspicious, and won't get used in homogenisation.
