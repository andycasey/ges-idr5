# Anything matching the propagate_flags_by_spectrum (when used as a PostgreSQL 
# `LIKE` query, e.g.: "TECH LIKE '%{spectrum_related_flag}-%'") will be 
# propagated to other results that use (any part of) the same spectrum. For 
# example, specifying '10100' will search for TECH entries matching '%10100-%' 
# (the dash - is included for you)
propagate_flags_by_spectrum:

    - 10100-11 # Saturated spectrum
    - 10103-11 # Suspicious or bad co-addition of exposures

    - 10150-11 # Suspicious or bad cross-correlation function (CCF)
    #   These are also spectrum-related flags for data reduction, but we won't propagate
    #   them because they won't affect all nodes in the same way
    #  10151-11 # No radial velocity determination
    #  10152-11 # Suspicious radial velocity determination
    #  10153-11 # Discrepant radial velocities (use suffix to specify the threshold; e.g., |RV_max-RV_min| > 5*err_RV )
    #  10154-11 # Abnormally large RV error (use suffix to specify the threshold)
    #  10155-11 # Revised radial velocity (use `VRAD' column to specify the new determination)
    #  10200-11 # No rotational velocity (v*sin(i)) determination
    #  10210-11 # Revised rotational velocity (v*sin(i); use `VSINI' column to specify the new determination)
  10105-11: # Incomplete spectrum (missing wavelengths)
    # Only if not IACAIP (node_id = 8) and not Nice (node_id = 10)
    constraint: "node_id != 8 AND node_id != 10"


# Anything matching these flags will cause us to mark that particular node 
# result as being suspicious, and won't get used in homogenisation.
